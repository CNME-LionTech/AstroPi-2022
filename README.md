# AstroPi 2021/2022 - Mission Space Lab code

## About us
We are a team of high school students (10th grade) from __Colegiul National Mihai Eminescu__ Oradea [(CNME)](http://www.eminescu.rdsor.ro/). 

## The project (mission description)
Last year our goal was to experiment if, based on identifying landmarks and reference points in pictures, we can determine the speed of the ISS ( using the altitude and taking into account the cameraâ€™s resolution) and to determine the dimensions of some natural landmarks in the pictures collected by our program. Also, we wanted to experiment and build an algorithm for the detection and classification of cloud patterns on land or sea images covered by clouds. We would like to extend and improve our mission by measuring and differentiating snow from the clouds in image classification, detecting possible storm or hurricane formation over the oceanic images, and measuring the albedo level in the pictures. We would like to improve our program and use the Coral neural network accelerator to perform storm and hurricane detection in real-time. We would also like to record data from the magnetic sensor and compare the data with a theoretical off-centered dipole model.

## Tech

Our project uses:
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
